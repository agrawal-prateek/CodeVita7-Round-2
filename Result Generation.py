Result Generation
Problem Description
In a programming competition, U number of users have qualified for the finale. The team has decided to ask P number of
problems in finale with different problem score (S) and number of test cases (T), based on complexity of the problem.

The problem IDs will be alphabetic equivalent from A, B, C and so on, for problems 1 to P, where first problem will have
problem Id as A, second will have problem Id as B and so on..

Any user may submit a problem multiple times. When a submission is done, all test cases for the problem are tried, and
a result given for each test case.

Each test case will end up in any one of the six below mentioned statuses.

A problem will be considered as solved,if and only if all test cases for that problem have status "Accepted".

For each problem, a user will get a full score or a partial score. He will get a full score (=Problem score) if there is
at least one submission where all test cases are in "Accepted" status. For each problem, a user will get a partial score
for the submission for that problem which has the highest number of test cases in the "Accepted" status. The partial
score given is score (problem score / number of test cases) for all test cases that end up with status "Accepted".

After the finale, next task of the team is to declare the result. The result is list of user who solved at least one
test case of any problem, posed in the contest in descending order of Full Score and then Partial Score. Note that if
only users who have at least one test case of any problem in the "Accepted" state, can be in the list.And if two or more
users have tied for the same rank, give same rank to all and sort them in ascending order on their userid and next
user's rank will be far away same number from them.

Suppose userid 34 and 45 have tied for 1st rank. Both of them placed for first rank and next user's rank will be 3rd.

Ex: 1 34 100 30
    1 45 100 30
    3 30 50 80
Help the team to declare result for the finale.

Constraints
P <=26

1<U<=10000

1< Su<=10000

Input Format
First linecontainstotal number of problems (P) in the Finale

Next P lines contains 3 space delimited integers denoting problem ID, problemscore (S) and number of test cases for that
problem (T)

Next line contains 2 space delimited integers denoting number of finalists (U) and total submissions by all finalists
(Su) in the Finale.

Next Su lines contain space delimited integers denoting userid, problem ID, submission ID and status code for each test
case in the problem delimited by space.

Output
Print the list of the users with their rank, userid, Full Score and Partial Score (two place of decimal) delimited by
space in ascending order of their rank.

Explanation

First 5 lines of input depict that there are 4 problems in finale viz. A, B, C and D. Their scores are 30, 30, 100 and
200 respectively. Number of test cases for each of them is 3, 7, 6 and 6 respectively.

Sixth line indicates that there are 2 finalists and together they have made 8 submissions.

Next 8 lines denote who has submitted solution to which problem and the corresponding status.

Upon crunching the data it turns out that userid 2 has topped the Finale by scoring 200 points as Full Score and 98.33
points as Partial Score. Userid1 is ranked at #2 and his Full Score is 100 and Partial Score is 15.

Explanation

First 3 lines of input depict that there are 2 problems in finale viz. A, and B. Their scores are 250 and 200
respectively. Number of test cases for each of them is 11 and 9 respectively.

Sixth line indicates that there are 5 finalists and together they have made 15 submissions.

Next 15 lines denote who has submitted solution to which problem and the corresponding status.

Upon crunching the data it turns out that userid 3 has topped the Finale by scoring 250 points as Full Score and 44.44
points as Partial Score. Userid 2 is ranked at #2 and his Full Score is 250 and Partial Score is 0.0 and so on.
